# Extracting-information-from-Tutorials-Point

In this project I have used python to scrap website. I have taken Tutorials Point website and scraped it extracting the different types of Tutorials offered by the Website with their corresponding URLS.

I have used Urllib and BeautifulSoup libraries to open and parse the website respectively. I have saved the data extracted in a .csv file.
